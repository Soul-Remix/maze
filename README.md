# Maze

<p>A randomly generated maze.</p>
<p>Your goal is to control the ball and reach the box at the bottom-right corner.<p>
<p>you can control the ball using the arrow keys or WASD</p>
<p>The difficulty depend on the screen size.</p>

[Live Page](https://soul-remix.github.io/maze/)

built using: [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)

<p>Controling with the mouse doesn't work correctly because of how matter.js deals with collision, the ball will just pass the walls</p>
